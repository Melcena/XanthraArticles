## Why Modern is a great format.

So, Magic the Gathering: The Trading Card Game (henceforth I will probably refer to it as MTG, or just magic) is something I have spent a lot of time with recently. Now this article will not presume any pre-knowledge about Magic, but anyone that has experience with Standard or (the now dead format) Extended will probably find this most informative. If you already play any of the other format (Modern, Legacy, Vintage etc) I assume that you have sufficent knowledge that some parts that you might find very uninteresting or basic, if that is the case feel free to jump to my opinions and conclusions rather than reading through all the basic parts.

**The basics permises of the Modern format.**

Standard is the most common and most easily format, and in reality probably the easiest to get into. Standard always contains the latest _core set_ (M13, M14 etc) and the two latest _blocks_(which usually means the latest 6 sets.)
Standard is therefore a _rotating_ format, when the first set of the third block come out, the entire oldest block will _rotate_ and no longer be valid for play. This is why Standard is so easy to get started with, the card pool is very limited and as the format changes quite quickly, the decktypes that are competative changes very often and is very seldom very mapped out. This was also the case of the now dead format Extended, which worked just like Standard but contained a larger (Extended =)) pool of cards by adding even more blocks to the rotation.

Modern on the otherhand is a _eternal_ format. That means that the cards in the format never rotate. Modern contains all cards from every block starting with the 8:th edition core set and Mirrordin block using the new (modern) frame template.
