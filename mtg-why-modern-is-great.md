## Why Modern is a great format.

So, Magic the Gathering: The Trading Card Game (henceforth I will probably refer to it as MTG, or just magic) is something I have spent a lot of time with recently. Now this article will not presume any pre-knowledge about Magic, but anyone that has experience with Standard or (the now dead format) Extended will probably find this most informative. If you already play any of the other format (Modern, Legacy, Vintage etc) I assume that you have sufficent knowledge that some parts that you might find very uninteresting or basic, if that is the case feel free to jump to my opinions and conclusions rather than reading through all the basic parts.

**The basics permises of the Modern format.**
Standard is the most common and most easily format, and in reality probably the easiest to get into.
